From the correlation matrix, we noticed that:
1. There is a  strong relationship between date and confirmed cases, deaths and recovered.
2. Deaths is strongly related to confirmed cases.
3. correlation between total score, reading, maths and science are weakly related to any of confirmed, deaths or recovered.
4. Weak relation between demography and number of cases.
5. 
It is strange that correlation coefficient is extremely high between snow depth and corona virus spread, #death, #recovery. This value is due to the large number of nulls in the column of snwd.
This is an interesting result that needs investigation later. It should be added to future work.
