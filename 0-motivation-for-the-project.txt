When we were happy with the annual festivals of new year, a virus was transfered, as first published on media, from bats to human beings in Wuhan, China. 
It was not critical untill the discovery of its exponential spread. It was spreading with a large speed that was not expected so governments and media didn't care for it a lot, untill it has spread out of control. 
It caused countries shut  many of their factories, distribution channels, restaurants and many people who get daily salaries have lost their jobs, at least temporarily. It lead to major losses in economy measured by trillions of dollars. 
For these reasons and some others, we started in investigating in reasons behind this virus spread to hinder it and to help getting a semi normal life to help those who have been affected by this  pandemic.
